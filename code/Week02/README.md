# Lecture 2 Homework Assignment: Implementing Validators Using Plutus

This homework assignment is intended to reinforce the skills you learned in this lesson; pushing your solutions to the PPP repository is not required.

You can check the homework yourself by running the following command within a week's directory.

```shell
cabal test
```

However, if you have any questions, please contact the IOG's Education Team on [the IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by posting your question on the `pioneers-questions` channel.

## Collaborate with the Pioneers Community

Remember that you can interact with the participants of the PPP through the [IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by joining the channels under the Plutus Pioneers category.

If during the program you have questions about Plutus, we invite you to share them at [Cardano Stack Exchange (CSE)](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) by adding the `plutus-pioneer-program` tag to your question. The IOG's Education Team members will monitor these questions to support your learning journey. Whenever you share a question at CSE, you're helping to build up the Cardano and Plutus development knowledge base.

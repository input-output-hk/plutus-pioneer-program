# Lecture 3 notes
Lecture notes based on the first ever official [Plutus-Pioneer program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program). This notes follow the [YouTube lecture 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk1eIVm_ZTQ).

## warnings! 
Codes for lectures 1 & lecture 2 will not work from this point onwards because the cabal tag has been updated. If you desire to work with the past week's codes you should return to an older git status of the main plutus repo. This can be achieved by typing

    $git checkout 3746610e53654a1167aeb4c6294c6096d16b0502
     
and rebuild Plutus with nix

## 0. Outline
New changes to the syntax as we move towards the Alonzo hard-fork event. Check and compare [`IsData.hs week02`](https://github.com/Igodlab/plutus-pioneer-program/blob/main/code/week02/src/Week02/IsData.hs) to this week's updated version: ['IsData.hs'](https://github.com/Igodlab/plutus-pioneer-program/blob/main/code/week03/src/Week02/IsData.hs)

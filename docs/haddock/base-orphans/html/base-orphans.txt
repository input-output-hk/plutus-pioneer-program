-- | Backwards-compatible orphan instances for base
--   
--   <tt>base-orphans</tt> defines orphan instances that mimic instances
--   available in later versions of <tt>base</tt> to a wider (older) range
--   of compilers. <tt>base-orphans</tt> does not export anything except
--   the orphan instances themselves and complements
--   <tt>&lt;<a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat</a>
--   base-compat&gt;</tt>.
--   
--   See the README for what instances are covered:
--   <a>https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-orphans#readme</a>. See also
--   the <a>what is not covered</a> section.
@package base-orphans

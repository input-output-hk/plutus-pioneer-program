-- | Run lifted IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results
--   
--   This package provides IO operations from <tt>async</tt> package lifted
--   to any instance of <a>MonadBase</a> or <a>MonadBaseControl</a>.
@package lifted-async
@version 0.10.2.3


-- | This is a wrapped version of <tt>Control.Concurrent.Async</tt> with
--   types generalized from <a>IO</a> to all monads in either
--   <a>MonadBase</a> or <a>MonadBaseControl</a>.
--   
--   All the functions restore the monadic effects in the forked
--   computation unless specified otherwise.
--   
--   If your monad stack satisfies <tt><a>StM</a> m a ~ a</tt> (e.g. the
--   reader monad), consider using
--   <tt>Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted.Safe</tt> module, which prevents
--   you from messing up monadic effects.

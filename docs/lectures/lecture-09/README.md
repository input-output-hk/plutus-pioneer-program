# Lecture 9

## Welcome to Lecture 9

Congratulations on completing Lecture 8 of the Plutus Pioneers Program (PPP)! In this lecture, you'll learn about stablecoins in Cardano. So, let's begin Lecture 9!

Remember that you can interact with the participants of the PPP through the [IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by joining the channels under the Plutus Pioneers category. So whether you're getting started with Plutus or a veteran participant of the PPP, we encourage you to pass by the [#pioneers-lounge chanel](https://discordapp.com/channels/826816523368005654/862912746847993887) and say hello!

If during the program you have questions about Plutus, we invite you to share them at [Cardano Stack Exchange (CSE)](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) by adding the `plutus-pioneer-program` tag to your question. The IOG's Education Team members will monitor these questions to support your learning journey. Whenever you share a question at CSE, you're helping to build up the Cardano and Plutus development knowledge base.
